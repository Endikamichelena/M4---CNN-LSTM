# M4---CNN-LSTM

## 2nd assignment - Fri 10 Feb.

We created a CNN using the MNIST dataset. Brief review of the main steps:

1st variation
  - Set hyperparameters.
  - Transform them to tensors and normalize those in a -1 1 range.
  - Class definition for the output.
  - Network's architecture definition
  - CrossEntropyLoss and SGD.
  - Training the neural network.
  - Accuracy check.

2nd variation, with same approach but different hyperparameters.

On the other hand, we created a LSTM using the data from last semester (M1 - Time series forecast). Main steps:

  - Data loading and normalization.
  - Define and initialize the LSTM model.
  - Training the model.
  - Evaluation.
  - Prediction making.
  - Plotting.
